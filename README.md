# Unit tests for RapidSense and related perception components

To run integration and regtests (assumes megadeb or fully built rapidplan):
```
$ ./scripts/run_perc_tests.sh
```

If you are not running on a RTR controller, and you do not have the resources for the timing dependent tests. Run:
```
$ ./scripts/run_perc_tests.sh -d
```
